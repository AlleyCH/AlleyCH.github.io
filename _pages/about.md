I'm born and raised in Canada and many know me as Alley. I'm a college graduate that studied software engineering in the form of game programming. In short I call myself a programmer. 

My background includes a mix of web development, game programming, and cybersecurity training at the Youth Employement Services. I enjoy working at the intersection of clean code and creative problem-solving. Whether itâ€™s improving tooling for a programming language or building responsive web apps, I love digging into projects that empower other developers.
