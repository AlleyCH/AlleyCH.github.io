***Hey GNOME and GSoC! 👋***

This is my first blog post on Planet GNOME and actually, my first blog post ever! I’ll be using this space to share updates on my Google Summer of Code 2025 project and other GNOME contributions I make along the way or even after GSoC ends. Of course, most posts for now will focus on my GSoC work.

***🛠️ My GSoC Project: Improving JSON, XML, and YAML Integration in Vala***

My GSoC project is about improving how Vala handles JSON, XML, and YAML. Right now, working with these formatting languages in Vala can be tedious. I’ll be contributing improvements to make parsing and emitting data in these formats easier and more intuitive for developers.

I'll also be diving into some compiler design topics and exploring Vala projects that already use these formats, to better understand current pain points and use cases.

***Thanks 🙏***

Also, big thanks to [Felipe Borges][Felipe-Borges] for maintaining Planet GNOME, and to my mentor [Lorenz Wildberg][Lorenz-Wildberg], who will be mentoring me on this project. 💙
