# Intro

I apologize that I'm a little late posting my blog, but over the past two weeks, I‚Äôve been diving into the Vala compiler and exploring how JSON (de)serialization could be integrated. My mentor, Lorenz, and I agreed that focusing on JSON is a solid entry point for now.

# Understanding the Vala Compiler

Learning the steps it takes to go from Vala code to C code is absolutely fascinating.

Vala's Compiler 101
* The first step in the compiler is lexical analysis. This is handled by [valascanner.vala][valascanner.vala], where your Vala code gets tokenized, which breaks up your code into chunks called tokens that are easier for the compiler to understand.
  <pre><code> switch (begin[0]) {
		case 'f':
			if (matches (begin, "for")) return TokenType.FOR;
			break;
		case 'g':
			if (matches (begin, "get")) return TokenType.GET;
			break;
  </pre></code>
  The code above is a snippet of the scanner, it‚Äôs responsible for recognizing specific keywords like for or get and returning the appropriate token type.

* Next is syntax analysis and the creation of the abstract syntax tree, managed by [valaparser.vala][valaparser.vala], which checks if your code structure is correct, for example, if that pesky '}' is missing. 

  <pre><code> inline bool expect (TokenType type) throws ParseError {
  	if (accept (type)) {
  		return true;
  	}
  
  	switch (type) {
  	case TokenType.CLOSE_BRACE:
  		safe_prev ();
  		report_parse_error (new ParseError.SYNTAX ("following block delimiter %s missing", type.to_string ()));
  		return true;
  	case TokenType.CLOSE_BRACKET:
  	case TokenType.CLOSE_PARENS:
  	case TokenType.SEMICOLON:
  		safe_prev ();
  		report_parse_error (new ParseError.SYNTAX ("following expression/statement delimiter %s missing", type.to_string ()));
  		return true;
  	default:
  		throw new ParseError.SYNTAX ("expected %s", type.to_string ());
  	}
  }
   </pre></code>
  This is a snippet of the parser and it tries to accept a specific token type, like again that '}'. If it's there, it continues parsing, if not it throws a syntax error.

* Then comes semantic analysis, the ‚Äúmeat and logic,‚Äù as I like to call it. This happens in [valasemanticanalyzer.vala][valasemanticanalyzer.vala], where the compiler checks if things make sense, do the types match? Are you using the correct number of parameters?

  <pre><code> public bool is_in_constructor () {
		unowned Symbol? sym = current_symbol;
		while (sym != null) {
			if (sym is Constructor) {
				return true;
			}
			sym = sym.parent_symbol;
		}
		return false;
	}
  </pre></code>

  this code that is a snippet of the semantic analzer helps the compiler understand if the current code is being analyzed within a constructor. It works by starting from the current symbol, which represents where the compiler is in the code and then moves up through its parent symbols. If it finds a parent symbol that is a constructor, it returns true, if it reaches the top without finding one, it returns false.

* After that, the flow analysis phase, located in [valaflowanalyzer.vala][valaflowanalyzer.vala], analyzes the execution order of your code. It figures out how control flows through the program, which is useful for things like variable initialization checking and unreachable code detection.

  <pre><code> public override void visit_lambda_expression (LambdaExpression le) {
  	var old_current_block = current_block;
  	var old_unreachable_reported = unreachable_reported;
  	var old_jump_stack = jump_stack;
  	mark_unreachable ();
  	jump_stack = new ArrayList<JumpTarget> ();
  
  	le.accept_children (this);
  
  	current_block = old_current_block;
  	unreachable_reported = old_unreachable_reported;
  	jump_stack = old_jump_stack;
  	}
  </pre></code>

  The a snippet of the flow analyzer and ensures that control flow like unreachable code or jump statements is properly analyzed within the lambda expression.

* Now we want to convert the Vala code into C code using a variety of Vala files in the directories [ccode][ccode] and [codegen][codegen].

All of these classes inherit from [valacodevisitor.vala][valacodevisitor.vala], which is basically the mother of classes that provides the 'visit_*' methods that allow each phase in the compiler to walk the source code tree.

I know this brief isn't all of what there is to understand about the compiler, but it's a start. Also, let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate everyone who‚Äôs contributed to Vala‚Äôs compiler design, it‚Äôs truly an art üé®


# The Coding Period Begins!!!

Now that GSoC's official coding period is here, I'm continuing my research on how to implement JSON support.

Right now, I'm still learning the codegen phase AKA the phase of converting vala into C, I‚Äôm exploring [json glib][json-glib] and starting to work on a valajsonmodule.vala in the code gen.

Another thing I want to work on is the Vala docs. The docs aren't bad, but I've realized the information is pretty limited the deeper you get into the compiler.

I‚Äôm excited that this is starting to slowly make sense, little by little.
