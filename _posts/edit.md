# Intro

I wanna start off and say I'm really glad that my last blog was helpful to many wanting to understand Vala's compiler. I hope this blog will also be informative and helpful.

I wanna talk a little about the basics of the compiler again, but this time, catering to the codegen phase. The phase that I'm actually working on, but has the least information in the Vala Docs.

In my past blog, I briefly mentioned the directories [codegen][codegen] and [ccode][ccode] being part of the codegen phase. This blog will be going more into depth about it. The codegen takes the AST and outputs the C code tree, so that it can be generated to C code more easily, usually by GCC or another C compiler you installed. When dealing with this phase, it's really beneficial to know and understand at least a little bit of C.


# [ccode][ccode]
* many of the files in the ccode directory are derived from CCodeNode, [valaccodenode.vala][valaccodenode.vala].
The files in this directory are representing C Constructs. For example the [valaccodefunction.vala] file repersents a c code function. C functions have function names, parameters, return types, and needs to be able to write out the function in C from vala source code.
  
   ``` vala
     //...
    	public override void write (CCodeWriter writer) {
    		writer.write_indent (line);
    		if (CCodeModifiers.INTERNAL in modifiers) {
    			writer.write_string (GNUC_INTERNAL);
    		} else if (is_declaration && CCodeModifiers.EXTERN in modifiers) {
    			writer.write_string ("VALA_EXTERN ");
    		}
    		if (!is_declaration && CCodeModifiers.NO_INLINE in modifiers) {
    			writer.write_string (GNUC_NO_INLINE);
    		}
    		if (CCodeModifiers.STATIC in modifiers) {
    			writer.write_string ("static ");
    		}
   //...
   ```
  
This code snipet is part of the ccodefunction file and what it's doing is overriding the 'write' function that is originally from ccodenode. It's actually writing out the the C code. 


# [codegen][codegen]
* The files in this directory are higher-level components responsible for taking the compilerâ€™s internal representation such as usually the AST and transforming it into the C code model ccode objects.
Going back to the example of the ccodefunction, codegen will take a function node from the abstract syntax tree (AST), and will create a new ccodefunction object. It then fills this object with information like the return type, function name, parameters, and body which are all derived from the AST. The the CCodeFunction.write() will generate the C code.

  ``` vala
  private void add_get_property_function (Class cl) {
  		var get_prop = new CCodeFunction ("_vala_%s_get_property".printf (get_ccode_lower_case_name (cl, null)), "void");
  		get_prop.modifiers = CCodeModifiers.STATIC;
  		get_prop.add_parameter (new CCodeParameter ("object", "GObject *"));
  		get_prop.add_parameter (new CCodeParameter ("property_id", "guint"));
  		get_prop.add_parameter (new CCodeParameter ("value", "GValue *"));
  		get_prop.add_parameter (new CCodeParameter ("pspec", "GParamSpec *"));
  
  		push_function (get_prop);
  
  ```
  
This code snippet is from [valagobjectmodule.vala][valagobjectmodule.vala] and it's calling CCodeFunction (again from the valaccodefunction.vala).  What this would out put is something that looks like this in C:

  ``` C
    void _vala_get_property (GObject *object, guint property_id, GValue *value, GParamSpec *pspec ) {
        
    }
  ``` 

## Now you might ask why?
Why do all this? 



# Looking at The Outputed C Code
Using the command 'valac -c yourfilename.vala' you'd be able to see the C code that Valac generates. If you were to look into it, you'd see a bunch of temp variables. It can be a little overwhelming to see if you don't really know C. 


'''
* Put the corresponding Vala code.

'''
* explain code

''' 
* put C codeeeeeee to prove point. 
'''

* explain code C

*** Explain how the directories are working together to gen the C code


I'm happy to say that I am making a lot of progress with the JSON module I mentioned last blog. *** explain how this ties into the code examples above....
