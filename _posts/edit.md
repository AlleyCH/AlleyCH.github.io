# Intro
Midterms are this week for GSoC, which means it's been half of my time in GSoC already. It's been an incredible experience so far, and I know it's gonna continue to be great. 

# YAML and XML
I've started to look into YAML and XML (mainly YAML). I've looked into main different libraries dealing with YAML. Libraries such as [pluie-yaml][pluie-yaml], yaml-glib, glib-yaml, and libyaml. Just like JSON, I used a GObject-integrated JSON library named json-glib. Now, to my understanding and research, there is no well maintained yaml library that intergrates GObject or Glib. I did mention [pluie-yaml][pluie-yaml], but this library isn't a C library. It's a shared Vala library. 


# What I've learned so far
I've learned quite a lot, but I still have so much more to learn and understand.

I want to go over the stuff I've learned, having done this much up till now.
